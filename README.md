# Tableau Project (Heart Failure Predictions Analysis) for CIS 4150 Foundations of Business Intelligence
# Overview
The report by Vanessa Munoz presents a project on heart failure predictions. The objective is to analyze heart failure data and understand the highest and lowest risk factors on different people who have heart conditions. The project uses two datasets on heart failure predictions and the analysis is conducted using Tableau Chart.
# Insight
The motivation of the project is to improve the rate of heart disease predictions and recovery in patients by identifying their risk factors through data visualization. The analytical questions focus on relationships between gender, chest pain types, work type, residence type, and smoking status in relation to heart disease. The datasets were obtained from Kaggle and the reference sources are two academic journals.
